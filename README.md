### What I learned

Coding this project taught me how to link to an external source(google fonts). It also added that challenge of, displaying an imaage using the imaage tags.

```html
<img class="qr-code-image" src ="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="qr code image" width="240">
```


### Continued development

Continued development in Javascript.
